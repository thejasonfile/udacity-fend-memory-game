## Description

A memory match game built with Javascript.  This is the project for section 2 in [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com/) Front-End Nanodegree (FEND) Program.

Dependencies include:
  * [Font Awesome v 5.0.13](https://fontawesome.com/)

  * [Google Font Coda](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Coda)

## Instructions

Click on a tile to reveal its icon.  Click on a second tile to see if you've made a match.  
  * If you have then the tiles remain shown and you move on to finding the next match.
  * If you have not made a match, then the tiles go back to being hidden and you have to find their match.

Once all matches have been found you will be told how many moves, seconds, and stars you have.

You can also reset the game using the 'Reset' button.
